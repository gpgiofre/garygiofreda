            <p>I <em>(Gary Paul Giofreda Jr.)</em> am a producer, drummer, engineer, apprentice electrician, student film actor, busboy, vigilante, aspiring fashion designer and all around obsessive of any and all parts of the creative process. My goal is to get the best performance out of an artist, then work with them to achieve the best and most fitting creative outcome for any given project; I am a mediator between creative ideas and the projects that come as a result.</p>
